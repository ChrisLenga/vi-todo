# vi-todo

This is a very baisc concept to a virtual intelligence to-do list tracker. Very beginning stages of brainstorming, but I've needed something that can help me track and notify me of items. I will slowly develop this over time to include a graphical interface, dates, priorities, and more. I may eventually even sync it up using an API to web applications, such as Google Calendar where it can auto add items based on date to my calendar. 

Really just toying around and shaking off some rust with Python though.
